We are using 6 different distribution methods for the same population mean to understnd how various plots vary. Although all the plots reflect similar distribution for 100 random number between the range of 20 to 2000.
Plots display expected behavier with most values showing sample mean close to 100.
Program will run normally with numpy and matplotlib libraries.
