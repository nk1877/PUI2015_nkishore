![Hospitality Price Vs Distance](Hospitality_price%20vs%20distance.png)


REVIEW

Plot compares the price variation between airbnb and hotels accomodation with respect to their proximity to  stations and landmarks. Plot looks neat with appropriate choice of contrasting colors for airbnb and hotel samples. Just looking at the plot may give wrong impression for choice of words like "rate" as it could be taken for rate of change. Price could be a better word. "hotel_airbnb_london" is not a very clear title. Maybe "price of hotels and airbnb vs their distace from station and landmark" be more apropriate choice.
