your plot reviews were ok, but a bit superficial not addressing all points. 9/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

the point size is redundant with the y position. redundant information is often used to reinforce an impression but it forces an opinion on the viewer thus it is generally dishonest.

axis labels too small, tick labels too small

the default three datapoints in the label should be changed to 1 since three are redundant 

the legend is too verbose and misused: the words next to the points must explain what the variable the points represent is. an extra label referring to axis would be needed here. 

axis missing units (ambiguity)

a space is missing in the title before the (

too many quantities in parenthesis (especially two consecutive parenthesis which is confusing



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


mmh555
============

the histograms with the horizontal display highlight the difference between man and women naturally

the colors are compliant with most color-blindness prescriptions and avoiding a red-based color for women is wise, as plotting man and women with blue-pink triggers preconceptions

the two plots should be included in the same panel to allow comparison

the y label "observations" is inaccurate and non informative




sv1379
============

the 3d as usual makes comparison difficult. additionally 3d bind distort the perception: we should compare differences in height but we are left with the impression given by he difference in volumes

the color is redundant with the year 

tick labels too small

the cause of death axis labels are offset with respect to the variable

typo in the title (parenthesis close that was never open)


sz1795
============
  
a meaningful comparison is impossible due to the large difference in the men values. if that was the point then a time series would be unnecessary. if the structure should have been compared then a time series should have been modified by multiplying by an appropriate constant and indicating that in the legend 

small axes labels

the axis labels should be words, not variable names: startdate -> "start date (startdate)"
