Description:

Idea behind our project is that younger people uses more bike rides than older people. We used 35 and below age as the range of younger people and 35 and above as older people. We also used 30 minutes plus rides as base to qualify for long rides and 30 minutes below as short rides.
Our data is filtered to include only user type subscriber as user type customer dont have their age mentioned in the data set. 

Contribution:

We worked in a group to discuss the idea and all of us came up with some idea and then we kept on modifying it till we finalized with this one.
My contribution was towards both the initial hypothesis finalization and programming part of the project. I also participated to clean and check codes for it to be free of errors. 

Instruction:

Code will work easily in ipython notebook when executed sequentially with appropriate libraries (pandas, numpy) installed in the system.

Note: Standard Statistical image needs to be saved in local drive to function (line 8).
